# AdventOfCode Solutions :santa:

This repository contains my solutions to the [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com) challenges.
It's made in TypeScript using Node

I am currently in the middle of adding new solutions every day, to compare with afterwards.

## :warning: Disclaimer
**[Because the competition is still ongoing](https://adventofcode.com/2023) please do NOT use my solutions to gain
an unfair advantage on friends, coworkers or anyone else you may be in a private leaderboard with.
Competing against a cheater will take away people's fun, and I don't want to be the reason for that.**

## :thinking: FAQ

### :christmas_tree: What is AdventOfCode?
[Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about)
People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

Challenges are released each day from the 1st to 25th of December.

### :snowflake: Where can I find your solutions?
My solutions can be found in [this package](src/days/2023)

### :sled: These solutions look rushed. Why is that?
It's because they are. I play AdventOfCode [competitively](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard) with my friends each year.
The faster you are done completing a challenge, the more points you get.

### :pencil: How can I run these solutions or make my own with this framework?
Awesome that you want to expand this codebase! To use this locally you have to follow some steps:

1. Copy the `.env.example` and name it `.env`;
2. Enter your `session` cookie from [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) into your `.env` file;
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages;
4. Test your solutions by running `npm start`!
